<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My career actually began before the Internet even existed. 
   As a child, I started getting involved with computers and hardware. 
   I had a dream back then; I actually wanted to become a game developer.</p>

<p>I had my first experience on the web with a friend. It was a sensation at that time. 
   The first modem was here, the Birthday of my personal Internet,
   everything was suddenly real. 
   I spent hours on my own computer trying to create something. 
   Yes, back then it was simple web development code. 
   My first project, I called it "MY VIRTUAL WORLD". </p>

<p>Later, after my training, I wanted to become a programmer. 
   I thought it should be Java. I tried to teach myself through tutorials. 
   Then I suddenly discovered tools that helped me give my designs a life. 
   What I used at the time were professional tools from Adobe. 
   Dreamweaver for web development and Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop 
   for creating and editing my designs.</p>

<p>Now I found servers interesting and started renting a virtual server from a host. 
  The first few days were a bit difficult. Everything had to be fast and secure. 
  Not an easy task for a newbie. The next challenge was born. 
  I liked Apache as a server, but it needed too many resources. 
  I experimented with the Cherokee Server Project and also with node.js, which was 
  very useful for me at the time.</p>

<p>
    I still design and work on my own web projects. 
    They were created in a web design program, they look great, but I lacked the framework
    of a website, I knew a few HTML tags, but no CSS and no JAVA-SCRIPT. So here I am, 
    going my own way. I want to become a professional. This is just the beginning of my 
    career as a web developer. My next goals will be Web 3.0 programming, block chain 
    and then Android or IOS apps, and web apps or cloud computing, maybe even AI.
